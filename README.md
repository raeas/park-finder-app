A Thinkful Assignemt

**Scenario** Your team is working on an app that will help folks plan a vacation. You've been assigned to work on one feature for the app - to display a list of national parks in an area.

1. Review The National Parks Services API documentation and create an API key.
2. Review the API Guide on Authentication for ways to pass your API key as part of the request.
3. Review the /parks endpoint and data model to understand how it works.
4.  Create a new app and push it to GitHub.

**Requirements:**
* The user must be able to search for parks in one or more states.
* The user must be able to set the max number of results, with a default of 10.
* The search must trigger a call to NPS's API.
* The parks in the given state must be displayed on the page. Include at least:
  * Full name
  * Description
  * Website URL
* The user must be able to make multiple searches and see only the results for the current search.
* As a stretch goal, try adding the park's address to the results.
